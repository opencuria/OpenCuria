# Runner

The runner executes Docker/QEMU workspaces and exposes lifecycle, execution,
files, terminal, desktop, and git interfaces. Agent and plugin policy belongs to
the backend. See the root [distributed setup](../README.md#-distributed-setup)
for Docker and native QEMU installation, or [source setup](../README.md)
for local development.

## Operations

- [Managed desktop resources](../docs/managed-desktop-resources.md): generic
  leases, persistent SQLite ownership stores, guest control directories,
  process-group cleanup limits, epoch recovery, and coordinated rollout.
- [Lifecycle recovery](../docs/image-lifecycle-implementation.md#recovery-hardening-operator-workflow).
